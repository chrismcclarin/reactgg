// The goal of this challenge is, using useReducer, add increment, decrement, undo, and redo functionality to your application. Unlike the other challenges, you'll need to wire up useReducer, the event handlers, and the reducer function yourself â€“ you won't need to touch the JSX though.

// TASKS
// Clicking increment should increment the counter
// Clicking decrement should decrement the counter
// Clicking undo and redo should undo or redo the previous action

import * as React from "react";

const initialState = {
    //notice the the past is the array of all past numbers for the undo
    //the present is the shown value
    //and the future is the array of all future numbers for the redo
    past: [],
    present: 0,
    future: []
};

            // the future is cleared because it is only applied when the user presses undo. 
            future: []
